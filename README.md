> Inspired by [`commit-message-emoji`](https://github.com/dannyfritz/commit-message-emoji).

Emojis make git messages more fund and have the nice side effects of making identifing the type of change easier.

Ask yourself, what would you rather write!?

```
feat: Added a sad feature

- Added xy
```

**OR**

```
✨ Yeah! Added a feature!

- woot woot!
```
